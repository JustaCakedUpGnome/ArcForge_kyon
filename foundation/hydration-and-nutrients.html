                <p>Most lifters today treat <strong>protein as gospel</strong> ‚Äî as if its mere presence guarantees muscular growth.<br>
                But this is an error of isolated thinking. <strong>Protein does not operate in a vacuum.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Without the substrates that power training and recovery ‚Äî <strong>carbohydrates, water, and sodium</strong> ‚Äî protein cannot be effectively utilized. No fuel, no engine. No hydration, no contraction. No sodium, no cellular transport.</p>
                
                <p>These aren't "tuning knobs" or supplemental tweaks for the advanced.<br>
                They are the <strong>base wiring</strong> of muscular performance and recovery ‚Äî and their neglect is why most trainees spin their wheels year after year, wondering why progress has stalled despite high protein intake.</p>
                
                <p>In this section, we'll <strong>dispense with dogma</strong>, and examine what your muscles actually require ‚Äî not according to trends or marketing, but <strong>according to biology.</strong></p>

                <p>Let's make this concrete:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    A pack of cheap Top Ramen may list <strong>1600mg of sodium</strong>, but your body might only absorb <strong>20‚Äì30%</strong> of that ‚Äî if that.
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Highly processed salts</strong> (like in instant noodles, fast food, or chips) are often bound with preservatives and anti-caking agents.</li>
                    <li>These additives reduce <strong>bioavailability</strong> ‚Äî the body recognizes them more as irritants than transport minerals.</li>
                    <li>Worse, these foods come <strong>void of balancing electrolytes</strong> like potassium and magnesium, so your body holds water inefficiently or expels it too fast.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote>
                    Salt isn't inherently bad. <strong>Garbage food with unbalanced salt loads is.</strong>

                <h3>The smart lifter's solution:</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Use <strong>mineral-rich salts</strong> like <strong>Celtic sea salt</strong> or <strong>pink Himalayan salt</strong> ‚Äî they contain trace electrolytes and absorb more cleanly.</li>
                    <li>Salt <strong>your whole foods</strong> with intent ‚Äî don't rely on junk for your mineral intake.</li>
                    <li>Drink enough water to match. Sodium works best <strong>with hydration</strong>, not against it.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You don't need to be neurotic about tracking milligrams ‚Äî just <strong>don't fear salt</strong>, and stop outsourcing your performance to the <strong>worst forms of it</strong>.</p>
                
                <p><em>Use it with purpose. Not as filler.</em></p>
                
                <div class="callout">
                    <p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong><br>
                    As a baseline: aim for <strong>3000‚Äì5000mg of sodium</strong> per day if you train intensely ‚Äî more if you sweat heavily or live in a hot climate.<br>
