### 📝 **Key Commands for Tomorrow:**
```bash
# Local development
python -m http.server 8000

# VPS deployment
git push origin redesign
# SSH to VPS, then:
git pull origin redesign
pm2 restart arcforge

# API testing
curl -X POST https://arcforge.tech/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPass123"}'
```

### 🎨 **Content Quality:**
