Notes: 

> Like Tom Platz said — **twice a month** is a sweet spot for squats when intensity is high and recovery is prioritized.

Alternate each lower-body session like this:

1. **Heavy squat(6-10) + quad focus**
    
2. **Deadlifts + hamstring/glute focus**
    
3. **Squats for higher reps(15-50)** (tempo or metabolic work)
    
4. **Deadlift variation or posterior chain burnout**
    

> That’s roughly 2 squat patterns and 2 hinge patterns over the course of a month.

**Rest Days (1–2 days)**  
Assess mental & physical readiness before restarting cycle.  
Recovery quality (1–10): _____ Weight/mirror check: ___________

**Progress Guidelines:**

- Only train if fully recovered (strength should trend upward)
    
- 1 working set per movement, to **absolute failure**
    
- If progress stalls: extend rest days or reduce volume
